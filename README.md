Commute-Driven Office Scheduling (CDOS)  

Backend using Java, MySQL, Kafka, REST API, Spring  

Project for Microsoft Azure hackathon  
Problem Statement:  
Many companies provide cab services to employees on fixed routes.  
After experiencing the success and benefits of work from home, many will continue to opt for WFH post Covid-19. But transport facility provided by the employer will still be a convenience desired by the employees.  
This would translate to plying of redundant number of office cabs and unnecessary costs.  
Proposed Solution:  
Reduce the number of fixed cab routes to a dynamic variable number of routes based on team collaboration requirements and individual employee needs. Decide who comes when to office based on the invites received from the colleagues and where they live.
